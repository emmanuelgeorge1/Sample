            <h4>

            <h5>
              The word comes from the Greek, Kalos and Sthenos meaning ‚ÄòBeauty‚Äô
              and ‚ÄòStrength‚Äô. It is the art and science of beautiful movement.
            </h5>

            <p>
              Bodyweight training represents exercise in its most natural form
              and combines strength training and basic gymnastic movements that
              can be done anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              It‚Äôs true that there is beauty in simplicity and calisthenics has
              been tried and tested over millennia leaving no doubt that it
              delivers exceptional results in all facets; movement, strength and
              aesthetics. Whilst the latter is a consideration at the School of
              Calisthenics we encourage people to focus on what your body can do
              rather than just what it looks like.
            </p>
            <p>
              The great thing about progressive bodyweight training is that with
              consistent training at an appropriate intensity, the two come
              together. You get a box full of gravity defying movement skills
              and, an athletic physique.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be successful in calisthenics you must learn to use the body as
              an integrated unit instead of individual and isolated muscles.
              This is good news as exposing yourself to exercises that require
              you to transfer force from hands to feet means a huge potential
              return when it comes to functional movement and robustness.
              Calisthenics will serve you well now, and into the latter years of
              your life.

              Research shows that setting and achieving goals, learning new
              things, being resilient and having a community to be part of can
              help make you happier. Calisthenics creates the opportunity to do
              all these things.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because the focus changes to what your body can do, instead of
              just what it looks like, issues with body image and dysmorphia can
              be reduced. Calisthenics also promotes mindfulness through a need
              to be present in your practice, particuarly in the skill
              acquisition phase of learning a new movement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Calisthenics is about more than just getting strong and taking
              cool photos. Your brain is a muscle that needs flexing as well and
              training it with progressively challenging movements is a great
              way to keep it sharp.
